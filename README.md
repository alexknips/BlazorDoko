> Now upgraded for [.NET core 3.2.0 preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-4-release-now-available/) - 
> please ensure you have installed the latest Blazor templates and VS 2019 preview.

This application demonstrates the use of [SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr) 
to create a Doppelkopf [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) application.

This is a fork of https://github.com/conficient/BlazorChatSample.

### Now JavaScript-Free!

library which is now compatible with the Mono WASM runtime. This really simplifies the 
`ChatClient` code.

Previously this sample used JavaScript SignalR client. If you want to see how the JavaScript client version worked, I've retained 
it in [this branch](https://github.com/conficient/BlazorChatSample/tree/netcore-3.2.0-preview1)

## Demo
A demo application is available at TODO
